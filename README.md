## ðŸ’¡Motivation

Soccer is the most popular sport with hundreds of millions of players and fans around the world. Many times, a key save can be the difference between winning and losing a game. KeeperVision is a training tool which aims to help goalkeepers in tackling their greatest hurdle - positioning. Using computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, KeeperVision physically guides goalkeepers in real-time to the best position to defend against any incoming shots. This is all packaged in an easy to use Android application.

## KeeperVision-App
Using computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, KeeperVision physically guides goalkeepers in real-time to the best position to defend against any incoming shots. The server is located in the repo https://github.com/nvsriram/KeeperVision/tree/main. This Android app is designed with Kotlin/Java to show and track user performance, user authentication, and conduct training sessions using live images and audible directives issued that interact with the server. Note that some secret keys have been redacted in the publishing of this app for Auth0 based authentication.
